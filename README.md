# FdF
FDF is a 42 Project to learn about 3d programming. The program takes a map as parameter and creates its 3d representation. It uses the library miniLibX, developed internally and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal with events linked to this window: keyboard, mouse and “expose”. Pretty much, this project introduces the events programming.
